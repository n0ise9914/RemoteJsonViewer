As you know its hard to read json logs in ide's console, therefore i created this tiny useful app.<br>
It listens on localhost:9128 and instantly parses incoming jsons.<br>
Usage sample: [JsonHelper.cs](https://github.com/n0ise9914/RemoteJsonViewer/blob/master/RemoteJsonViewer/JsonHelper.cs)<br><br>
